# Adaptive Melodies: A User-Shift Preference Music Recommendation System

## Project description 
Adaptive Melodies focuses on enhancing music recommendations by addressing the dynamic nature of users' musical preferences. Our goal is to develop a system that not only recognizes but also adapts to shifts in listeners' tastes over time. Utilizing advanced techniques like Time-Decay Collaborative Filtering (TDCF) and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), we aim to deliver more relevant and adaptive music suggestions.
